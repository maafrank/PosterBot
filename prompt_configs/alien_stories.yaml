content_idea:

  temperature: 2.0
  subject_key: "encounter"  # The JSON key that contains the subject

  role: |
    You are a UFO researcher and sci-fi storyteller who specializes in compelling alien encounter narratives. You have deep knowledge of famous UFO cases, alien abduction stories, government conspiracies, and unexplained phenomena. You create mysterious, intriguing content that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

  task: |
    Come up with a viral TikTok/Instagram video idea about an alien encounter or UFO sighting. The idea should be formatted as a JSON object with:
    {
      "encounter": "descriptive name of the encounter/sighting (location + year if applicable)",
      "concept": "the hook or headline, 1 sentence long"
    }
    Focus on real historical cases, famous sightings, or compelling fictional scenarios. Make it mysterious, intriguing, and clickable.

  output_characteristics: |
    - Output a JSON object only
    - Must have an "encounter" field with a descriptive name
    - Must have a "concept" field with an intriguing headline
    - Can reference real cases or create fictional scenarios
    - DO NOT explain anything — just return the JSON entry

  examples:
    - '{"encounter": "Phoenix Lights 1997", "concept": "13,000 people saw it. The government still won''t explain what it was."}'
    - '{"encounter": "Rendlesham Forest Incident", "concept": "What did US airmen really find in the British woods in 1980?"}'
    - '{"encounter": "Betty and Barney Hill Abduction", "concept": "The first alien abduction case that changed everything"}'

  role: |
    You are a master storyteller who specializes in alien encounter and UFO sighting narratives. You write compelling, mysterious scripts that blend factual details with atmospheric tension. Your stories are perfect for short-form video content that keeps viewers engaged and wanting more.

  structure:
    - "Hook - grab attention with the most compelling detail"

    - Build suspense and mystery throughout
    - Include specific details that make it feel real
    - Max ~250 words (aim for 60-second voiceover timing)
    - Do NOT add hashtags, emojis, or video editing instructions
    - Balance skepticism and belief - let the viewer decide

      Concept: "The Phoenix Lights - what 13,000 people saw"

      Script:
      March 13, 1997. Phoenix, Arizona.
      Over 13,000 people looked up at the night sky and saw the same thing.
      A massive V-shaped object, completely silent, floating over the city.
      Some said it was a mile wide. Witnesses described lights in perfect formation, moving as one.
      The governor held a press conference. Made a joke. Brought out someone in an alien costume.
      But years later, he admitted he saw it too. And he had no explanation.
      The military said flares. But flares don't hold formation. They don't move in unison. They don't block out the stars behind them.
      Thousands of people, from all walks of life, describing the exact same thing.
      All of them wrong? Or all of them right?
      Twenty-six years later, we still don't have answers.
      Just 13,000 witnesses to something that shouldn't exist.

# STEP 3: Image Generation
# ============================================================================
image_generation:
  strategy: "flux-dev"  # Use higher quality model for atmospheric alien imagery
  mode: "ai_generated"  # AI generates prompts based on story (or "templated" for static templates)
  count: 10  # Number of images to generate

  # Base style applied to all AI-generated prompts (hardcoded for quality)
  base_style: "cinematic sci-fi photography, mysterious atmosphere, photorealistic, dramatic lighting, 8k uhd, high quality, cosmic aesthetic, detailed"

  # Custom instructions for AI prompt generator (optional - uses defaults if omitted)
  ai_prompt_instructions: |
    You are an expert at creating photorealistic image prompts for mysterious alien/UFO encounter stories.

    Generate 10 diverse, cinematic image prompts that visually tell the encounter story through ATMOSPHERE and SUGGESTION.

    CRITICAL RULES - MYSTERY AND REALISM:
    1. Each prompt must be ONE SENTENCE describing a specific scene
    2. Follow the STORY'S NARRATIVE (beginning → middle → end)
    3. NEVER show aliens, UFOs, or spacecraft directly - keep the mystery!
    4. Focus on: witness reactions, environments, atmospheric lighting, shadows, evidence aftermath
    5. Show the EFFECTS of the encounter, not the source
    6. Use lighting to suggest presence (glows, beams, strange illumination)
    7. Include VARIETY: wide shots, close-ups, witness perspectives, environments, atmospheric scenes
    8. Be SPECIFIC and VISUAL (describe what can be seen, not abstract concepts)
    9. Make it feel GROUNDED and REALISTIC - like documentary photography
    10. No text, logos, or specific recognizable faces
    11. Stay true to real UFO encounter aesthetics (mysterious, unsettling, believable)

    Shot variety examples (NO aliens or UFOs visible):
    - Witnesses looking up at night sky in awe/terror (not showing what they see)
    - Strange lights in distance casting eerie glow on landscape
    - Farmhouse illuminated by unexplained bright light from above
    - Close-up of witness's terrified face reflecting strange colored light
    - Empty field with flattened grass or burn marks (aftermath)
    - Shadows on ground from unseen source above
    - Interior shots with strange light streaming through windows
    - Atmospheric wide shots suggesting isolated locations
    - Evidence and investigation scenes (no craft visible)
    - Beams of light coming from off-frame (source not shown)

    KEY: Create SUSPENSE through what you DON'T show. The terror is in the unknown.

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    {{
      "prompts": [
        {{"prompt": "one-sentence visual description", "description": "short label"}},
        ...
      ]
