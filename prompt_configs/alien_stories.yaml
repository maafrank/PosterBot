  role: |
    You are a UFO researcher and sci-fi storyteller who specializes in compelling alien encounter narratives. You have deep knowledge of famous UFO cases, alien abduction stories, government conspiracies, and unexplained phenomena. You create mysterious, intriguing content that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

  task: |
    Come up with a viral TikTok/Instagram video idea about an alien encounter or UFO sighting. The idea should be formatted as a JSON object with:
    {
      "encounter": "descriptive name of the encounter/sighting (location + year if applicable)",
      "concept": "the hook or headline, 1 sentence long"
    }
    Focus on real historical cases, famous sightings, or compelling fictional scenarios. Make it mysterious, intriguing, and clickable.

  output_characteristics: |
    - Output a JSON object only
    - Must have an "encounter" field with a descriptive name
    - Must have a "concept" field with an intriguing headline
    - Can reference real cases or create fictional scenarios
    - DO NOT explain anything — just return the JSON entry

  examples:
    - '{"encounter": "Phoenix Lights 1997", "concept": "13,000 people saw it. The government still won''t explain what it was."}'
    - '{"encounter": "Rendlesham Forest Incident", "concept": "What did US airmen really find in the British woods in 1980?"}'
    - '{"encounter": "Betty and Barney Hill Abduction", "concept": "The first alien abduction case that changed everything"}'

      Concept: "The Phoenix Lights - what 13,000 people saw"

      Script:
      March 13, 1997. Phoenix, Arizona.
      Over 13,000 people looked up at the night sky and saw the same thing.
      A massive V-shaped object, completely silent, floating over the city.
      Some said it was a mile wide. Witnesses described lights in perfect formation, moving as one.
      The governor held a press conference. Made a joke. Brought out someone in an alien costume.
      But years later, he admitted he saw it too. And he had no explanation.
      The military said flares. But flares don't hold formation. They don't move in unison. They don't block out the stars behind them.
      Thousands of people, from all walks of life, describing the exact same thing.
      All of them wrong? Or all of them right?
      Twenty-six years later, we still don't have answers.
      Just 13,000 witnesses to something that shouldn't exist.

# STEP 3: Image Generation
# ============================================================================
image_generation:
  strategy: "flux-dev"  # Use higher quality model for atmospheric alien imagery
  mode: "ai_generated"  # AI generates prompts based on story (or "templated" for static templates)
  count: 10  # Number of images to generate

  # Base style applied to all AI-generated prompts (hardcoded for quality)
  base_style: "cinematic sci-fi photography, mysterious atmosphere, photorealistic, dramatic lighting, 8k uhd, high quality, cosmic aesthetic, detailed"

  # Custom instructions for AI prompt generator (optional - uses defaults if omitted)
  ai_prompt_instructions: |
    You are an expert at creating photorealistic image prompts for alien/UFO content.

    Generate 10 diverse, cinematic image prompts that visually tell the alien encounter story.

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. Each prompt must be ONE SENTENCE describing a specific scene
    2. Follow the STORY'S NARRATIVE (beginning → middle → end)
    3. Include VARIETY: wide shots, close-ups, witness perspectives, UFO craft, atmospheric scenes
    4. Be SPECIFIC and VISUAL (describe what can be seen, not abstract concepts)
    5. Make prompts MYSTERIOUS and ATMOSPHERIC
    6. No text, logos, or specific recognizable faces
    7. Stay true to UFO/alien encounter aesthetics

    Shot variety examples:
    - Night sky with mysterious lights
    - Witness perspectives (looking up, awestruck)
    - UFO craft details and formations
    - Landing sites or environments
    - Atmospheric/mysterious scenes
    - Government documents or investigation scenes
    - Beams of light, glowing phenomena

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    {{
      "prompts": [
        {{"prompt": "one-sentence visual description", "description": "short label"}},
        ...
      ]
    }}
