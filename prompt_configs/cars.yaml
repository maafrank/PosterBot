# ============================================================================
# STEP 1: Content Idea Generation
# ============================================================================
content_idea:
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  temperature: 2.0
  subject_key: "car"  # The JSON key that contains the subject

  role: |
    You are an edgy automotive content creator with deep knowledge of car culture, engineering quirks, internet memes, and enthusiast drama. You specialize in short-form video content that is provocative, opinionated, and funny.

  task: |
    Come up with a viral TikTok/Instagram video idea. The idea should be formatted as a JSON object with:
    {
      "car": "the full name and year range of the car featured",
      "concept": "the hook or headline, 1 sentence long"
    }
    The idea should be short, controversial, or intriguing, and formatted as a video hook. Avoid generic car reviews. Think meme-worthy, spicy, internet-argument-fueling content.

  output_characteristics: |
    - Output a JSON object only
    - Each object must have a "car" field with a year + model
    - Each object must have a "concept" field with a dramatic or sarcastic headline
    - Mention generation, model, and years
    - DO NOT explain anything — just return the JSON entry

  examples:
    - '{"car": "2001–2004 Porsche 996", "concept": "Why the 996 is the most hated 911 (and why that''s dumb)"}'
    - '{"car": "1990–1999 Mazda Miata (NA)", "concept": "The Miata: proof that fun beats horsepower"}'

# STEP 2: Story/Script Writing
# ============================================================================
story_writer:
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  temperature: 1.9
  max_words: 250
  tone: "first-person narrator, opinionated, humorous, casual"

  role: |
    You are an edgy automotive content writer who creates viral short-form video scripts for TikTok and Instagram. You combine car knowledge, humor, and controversy to keep car enthusiasts engaged for 60 seconds or less.

  structure:
    - "Hook (first line should grab attention)"
    - "Drama / conflict / unusual fact"
    - "Breakdown of why it matters"
    - "Punchline, twist, or unexpected takeaway"
    - "Optional call to action (Would you buy this? Follow for more car drama)"

  instructions: |
    - Write it in first-person narrator voice
    - Use short sentences and casual tone
    - Include subtle humor or sarcasm
    - Assume video will be paired with images/video clips of the car
    - Max ~250 words (aim for 60-second voiceover timing)
    - Do NOT add hashtags, emojis, or video editing instructions
    - Kind of roast the car but actually hype the car up!

      Concept: "Why the Porsche 996 sucks"

      Script:
      The Porsche 996 is the most hated 911 ever made.
      It showed up with headlights that looked like scrambled eggs and an interior that felt cheaper than a 90s Corolla.
      But the real kicker? The infamous IMS bearing—a tiny part that can grenade your entire engine.
      Suddenly, buying a used 911 came with the same level of anxiety as dating a Hollywood starlet.
      Still… it's got a flat-six. Rear-engine. Manual gearbox. And now it's the cheapest way into the 911 club.
      So does it suck? Yeah. Do we love it anyway? Also yeah.
      Would you risk it?
